- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsflorus
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything that have something to do with computer science. I am also a huge sport/space/physics/aronautic fan (I know... I love a lot of stuff).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything. But as I am a confirmed React-js dev, I am actually working on improving my skills in Java and C++ development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything. I just want to help and have fun while working on different projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ? I am a little bat so it is pretty complicated. But as I am very cool, just send me an email at tsflorus@gmail.com ^^
